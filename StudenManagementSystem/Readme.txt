How It Works:  
1. The application displays a menu with options for different operations.
2. The user selects an option (1â€“5) to perform a desired action.
3. Student data is stored in a `HashMap<Integer, Student>` where the key is the student ID.
4. The application continues running until the user selects the "Exit" option.

How to Run:  
1. Compile the Java file using a terminal or command prompt:
   javac StudentManagementSystem.java

2. Run the compiled class:
   java StudentManagementSystem

Example Menu Output:
