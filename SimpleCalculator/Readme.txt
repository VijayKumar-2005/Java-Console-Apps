Project Title:  
Simple Java Calculator

Description:  
This is a console-based calculator application written in Java. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program runs in a loop, allowing multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit.

Features:  
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division operations  
- User-friendly menu-driven interface  
- Error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero  
- Clean and readable output formatting

How It Works:  
1. The application displays a welcome message and a list of operations to choose from.
2. The user selects an operation (1–4) or exits (5).
3. The user is then prompted to enter two numbers.
4. The selected operation is performed and the result is displayed.
5. The process repeats until the user selects the "Exit" option.

How to Run:  
1. Compile the Java file using a terminal or command prompt:
   javac SimpleCalculator.java

2. Run the compiled class:
   java SimpleCalculator

Example Menu Output:
=========================================
       Welcome to the Calculator

Select an operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (×)
4. Division (÷)
5. Exit
Enter your choice (1-5): 

Note:
